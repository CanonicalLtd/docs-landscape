Title: Landscape Autopilot

# Landscape Autopilot

## Introduction

Autopilot is a feature of Landscape that allows one to build and manage an
OpenStack cloud. It uses other core Canonical technologies, Juju and MAAS, in
order to do this. The actual cloud, however, is pure OpenStack, including the
Horizon dashboard that most open-source cloud users are already familiar with.

## Installation

A minimum of 5 machines will be needed, 2 of which have the following
minimum requirements:

 * 2 disks (block devices)
 * 2 network cards
