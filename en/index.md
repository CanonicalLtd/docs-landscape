Title: Landscape

# Introduction to Landscape

Landscape is a system management tool designed to let you easily manage multiple Ubuntu systems - up to 40,000 with a single Landscape instance. From a single dashboard you can apply package updates and perform other administrative tasks on many machines. You can categorize machines by group, and manage each group separately. You can make changes to targeted machines even when they are offline; the changes will be applied next time they start. Landscape lets you create scripts to automate routine work such as starting and stopping services and performing backups. It lets you use both common Ubuntu repositories and any custom repositories you may create for your own computers. Landscape is particularly adept at security updates; it can highlight newly available packages that involve security fixes so they can be applied quickly. You can use Landscape as a hosted service as part of [Ubuntu Advantage](https://buy.ubuntu.com/), or run it on premises via Landscape On Premises Server.
